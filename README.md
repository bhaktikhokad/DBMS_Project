#  Online Restaurant System


â€œThe objective of this online restaurant project is to design a database to centrally  handle the details of all the customers and to provide access to this information  with an easy-to-use Graphic user interface that can be accessed by any device  with basic Java (swing ) rendering capabilities".

### Problem Statement:

Our proposed system is an online Restaurant system that enables ease for customers. It overcomes the disadvantages of the traditional queueing system. Our proposed system is 
a medium to order hassle-free online food from restaurants and mess service. This system improves the method of taking orders from customers. The online food ordering 
system sets up a food menu online and customers can easily place the order as per their wish. Also with a food menu, customers can easily track their orders. For more secure 
ordering separate accounts are maintained for each user by providing them an ID and a password. 

#### Key Features :

1.An online food ordering system is software that lets restaurants, coffee shops, or bars accept orders online. It typically allows customers to choose and pay for food, then alerts 
the kitchen when an order is made. This happens without contact between staff and customers.

2.Here we have inculcated the basic and advanced feature of mysql Our database dbms_miniproject has in total 5 tables namely Admin , Customer, Menu, Cart, Order using which we have made our login signup frames.

3.Using jdbc connect in java we have given admin the facility of altering the menu and viewing the list of customers And customers with the facity of adding items from menu to the cart.

4.In our first frame we get options to login as ADMIN, NEW USER and OLD USER Where clicking on ADMIN the login page of admin pops up clicking on NEW USER the signup page of the new user opens up
clicking on OLD USER the login page of user opens up.

5.After a successfully login as ADMIN we get to the page showing the functionalities of the admin where we can choose if we want to alter the menu or view the details of the customers.

6.After a successful login as the USER we get to the page showing the functionalities of the user where we can choose to alter the cart of simply just view the menu.

7.Here we used the swing GUI where we inculcated buttons, frames, panels, labels and text boxes into our program .

8.The connectivity of a button to another frame was carries out by the setVisible function.Eg : new login().setVisible(true);

9.We have also made an exit button which terminates our entire project using the simple function of System.exit(0).

10.We used a wide variations of colours and font which makes our project more user interactive.
